# rCalc

A simple yet cool resistance color code calculator. The idea of this WebApp is to serve as a awesome (and useful) experiment for things like Offline WebApps, Firefox OS, and Chrome Packaged Apps. There's also a [desktop version](https://github.com/nathanpc/rcalc-desktop) if you don't like web stuff.


## Supported Platforms

This is a experiment with web platforms, so these are the platforms fully supported by rCalc:

 - Desktop Chrome and Firefox
 - Most mobile web browsers
 - **Firefox OS**
 - **Chrome Packaged App**


## Availability

Since I love all the "WebStores" I decided to publish it on several places:

 - [Normal Boring WebApp URL](http://rcalc.dreamintech.net/)
 - [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/rcalc/)
 - [Chrome WebStore - Packaged](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ijcmcfeebbeeggajifmbkmkobkgdilkj)
 - [Chrome WebStore - Hosted](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rcalc/aabdamdpbigmedbidolnefhepdocfjpg)
